Not sure where to answer the questions so I'm just answering them here:

1. The LDS religion has the strongest correlation between non-religious people and the religion. The R^2 value 
is .7565 which means that the correlation that it has is the square root of that number, which is about -0.87 
(negative since it has a negative relationship)

2. That correlation is negative since the more non-religious proportion there is, the less LDS proportion 
there is.

3. Episcopal has the second largest one. Their R^2 value is .3557, which means they have about a .60 correlation.

4. It has a positive relationship since the more non religious proportion there is, the higher the proportion 
of Episcopal.

5. The Episcopal may not be a linear relationship, it looks a little more exponential but it may just appear 
that way with this smaller data set. It may honestly just be that the one extremely positive outlier makes it 
seem that way. The LDS church seems to be pretty linear and pretty strong, which makes sense given the known 
demographics of Utah.
